LMRG_Study3_Sample prep protocols
The third study of the Light Microscopy Research Group (LMRG) is aimed at creating a 3D biologically relevant test slide and imaging protocol to test for: (1) System resolution and distortions in 2D and 3D. (2) The dependence of Intensity quantification and image signal-to-noise of the microscope on imaging depth. (3) The dependence of the microscope sensitivity on imaging depth. The test sample consists of a mixture of fluorescence microspheres imbedded in a 120 um-thick layer of CyGel (BioStatus, UK, Cat# Cy10500) with a refractive index of 1.37 closely matched to biological tissue. A double-sided adhesive 18 mm square spacers with a well (9 mm diameter, 120 um deep) were used for the sample preparation (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Cat# 70327-8s). The mixture of microspheres includes 1 um Orange, 2.5 um Green 20% brightness, 2.5 um Green 100% brightness, 6 um Far Red 36%, 6 um Far Red, 15 um Blue Core/Orange Ring.
