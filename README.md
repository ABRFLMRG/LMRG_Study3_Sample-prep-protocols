# LMRG_Study3_Sample-prep-protocols

This is a global study conducted by the Association of Biomedical Resource Facilities (ABRF) Light Microscopy Research Group (LMRG). The goal was to create a 3D biologically relevant standard slide that was affordable and straightforward to prepare. Detailed instrument specific image acquisition protocols and image analysis methods were also developed and listed here. The 3D standard allows a microscopist to evaluate the performance of their microscope as a function of imaging depth (up to 100 µm) in the following areas: (1) Intensity quantification and image signal and noise; and (2) microscope resolution through automated analysis of the point spread function (PSF) quality, both through the 3D volume. The test samples consist of different mixtures of fluorescence microspheres embedded in a 120 µm-thick layer of CyGelTM, a thermo-reversible 3D cell growth media. 

Detailed sample prep instruction and sample kit info are posted in this repository.
